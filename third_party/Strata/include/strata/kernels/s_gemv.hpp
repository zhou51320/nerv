//
//     value = cb[code] * scale + offset

// canonical form - 13 source types collapse to three code widths and a handful of attributes - so the kernel

// carries them per tensor (round 163 added the tests that keep it honest).

// makes the parallelism independent of the output width.
//
// It is NOT bit-identical to `s_gemv`: the partial sums are added in a different order, so the parity test
