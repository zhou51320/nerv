// include/strata/kernels/s2_expert_grouped.hpp - R4's GPU expert tier.
//
// **WHAT THIS IS FOR.** The CPU expert pool is the engine's largest single cost - 663.6 MB of expert bytes per
// token at ~40 GB/s = 16.2 ms on a ~53 ms token - and `test_expert_pool` measures the pipeline hiding
// **1.055 ms of 19.035**. The CPU work is 96% exposed because the residual chain is strictly serial, so the
// only way past it is to stop reading those bytes on the CPU: put experts in VRAM and compute them on the GPU.
//
// **WHY GROUPED, AND WHY THAT WORD IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.** A layer routes ten experts. The obvious
// implementation is a loop over hits calling the per-matrix kernel, and it is wrong by arithmetic: five
// launches per expert at ~6.45 hits and 48 layers is **~1,550 launches per token**, which at a real-stream
// launch cost of ~3.6 us is 5.6 ms - most of the 10.4 ms the tier is supposed to save. So the hits are grouped
// into ONE launch per projection:
//
//     1. `gu_kernel`    n_hits x 2 x FF rows   - gate and up, together
//     2. `swiglu_kernel` n_hits x FF           - silu(gate) * up
//     3. `quantize_q8_0` (the existing one)    - the down weight's own activation contract
//     4. `down_kernel`   n_hits x H rows
//
// **four launches per layer, not five per expert.**
//
// `h_layer` held-out is **0.0456** - only 4.6% of (layer, token) pairs have all ten experts resident - so this
// cannot be a per-layer grouped kernel with a fixed grid, and the hit list is passed **as data** so the caller
// can keep one captured graph per layer with the maximum grid and a device-side count.

/// **ONE GROUPED EXPERT EVALUATION.**  For each hit `h` in `[0, n_hits)`, evaluates the expert held in
/// `blob_base + slot_index[h] * blob_bytes` against `x_q8_0` and writes `n_embd` floats to
/// `out + dst_index[h] * n_embd`.
///
/// * `blob_base`    the device slot arena; slot `s` starts at `blob_base + s * blob_bytes`
/// * `slot_index`   `n_hits` `int32_t` slot indices on the DEVICE, so the caller can change which experts are
///                  resident without recapturing anything
/// * **`dst_index`   where each hit's answer goes, also on the device and also `n_hits` long.**
///
///                  **THIS IS NOT A CONVENIENCE - IT IS WHAT LETS THE TWO HALVES MEET.**  A layer routes ten
///                  experts and only some are resident, so the CPU produces the misses at their ROUTED indices
///                  (the router's order is what `moe_combine` weights against) and the GPU produces the hits in
///                  whatever order the cache happens to hold them.  Writing the hits sequentially would land
///                  them on the misses' rows; `dst_index` puts hit `h`'s answer on the row its expert was routed
///                  to, so the CPU can zero the hit rows, the GPU can fill them, and `moe_combine` needs no
///                  change at all.
/// * `x_q8_0`       `(n_embd/32)` `block_q8_0`, 34 bytes each, from `quantize_q8_0`
/// * `scratch`      `moe_hit_grouped_scratch_bytes(n_hits, n_embd, n_ff)`, caller-owned
/// * `out`          `(k, n_embd)` floats - the SAME buffer the misses were written into
/// * **`x_scales`    R4.2h, OPTIONAL, and null keeps the previous behaviour exactly.**  When non-null it is
///                  `n_embd/32` **fp32** activation scales from `quantize_q8_0_scaled`, and they REPLACE the
///                  block's fp16 `d` as the activation multiplier - for the gate/up projection and for the
///                  intermediate's own quantization in step 3.
///
///                  **THIS EXISTS BECAUSE A HIT AND A MISS MUST PRODUCE THE SAME NUMBER.**  The CPU pool
///                  multiplies by the fp32 `ActQ::scale` (`cpu/expert.cpp:92`); this kernel read fp16 `d` out
///                  of the `block_q8_0`.  `bench/micro/act_quant_parity.cu` measured the gap with both real
///                  implementations linked: **80 of 80 chunks differ, max relative 4.761e-04** - 2^-11, pure
///                  fp16 rounding - which is why enabling the cache changed the generated tokens.  Pass null
///                  and this is bit-for-bit the kernel `moe_hit_parity` has always checked at 6.279e-08.
///
/// **THE BLOB LAYOUT IS `expert.hpp`'s AND IS NOT RESTATED HERE.**  Gate/up codes are interleaved by row
/// (`2r` = gate, `2r+1` = up), the down codes follow, and each plane's scales are fp16 - which is the ONE
/// difference from `s_gemv_q8`'s S-forms, whose scales are fp32.  That difference is why this is a separate
/// kernel rather than a call into the dense path.
