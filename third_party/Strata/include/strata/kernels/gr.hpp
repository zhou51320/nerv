// include/strata/kernels/gr.hpp - the gated residual (hyper-connection), P2.S2.
//
// `ref/gr.py::gr_read` / `gr_write`, which are transcribed from
// `llama_model_qwen4exp::graph::build_hc_mix` / `build_hc_combine` (qwen4exp.cpp L267-350 at 3cf03257).
//
// The residual is a STACK of `hc` streams, each `n_embd` wide - not one vector with a gate.  `gr_read`
// collapses the stack to the one vector the mixer consumes and produces a per-stream injection; `gr_write`
// puts the mixer's output back into every stream, weighted per stream.
//
// WEIGHTS ARE BF16, stored as the high 16 bits of an f32 in a `uint16_t`.  That is not a shortcut: every one
// of these tensors has source type BF16 in the pack (288 of the shard's 483 BF16 tensors are `hc_*`), so the
// pack's 32-bit promotion is lossless padding and re-rounding to 16 bits costs nothing.  It is also worth
// 1.374 GiB of the 5.305 GiB dense file, which is the difference between the dense weights fitting in VRAM
// beside the expert cache and not fitting at all.
//
// The default activation contract is the historical BF16-rounded reference.  The opt-in FP32 contract
// matches the pinned llama.cpp CUDA single-token BF16 MMVF input precision: BF16 weights multiply FP32
// activations.  The CPU oracle and some batched CUDA paths instead round activations to BF16.  Therefore
// activation precision must be pinned with the oracle backend and batch geometry, not inferred from weights.

/// **NO PERMUTATION: both matrices are taken exactly as the manifest stores them**, so the loader does nothing

/// either orientation.  An earlier version assigned one THREAD per row, which is coalesced with itself and 32
/// transactions away from its warp neighbours - see the history below.
///
/// **HISTORY, because this kernel was the engine's worst and the reason is instructive.**  The first version
/// was launched `<<<1, 256>>>` with `xn`/`xq` in shared memory, and at the real geometry it cost **2.67 ms per
/// call, 96 calls per token = 262 ms/token, about 3.8 tok/s, 134x off the 643 GB/s memory floor.**  The cause
/// was isolated by elimination: NOT memory latency (four independent accumulator chains made it 17% SLOWER),
/// NOT the SM clock (`nvidia-smi` reported 2917 MHz and 99% utilisation throughout), and only partly
/// coalescing (transposing one of the two matrices gave 31% and transposing the other gave nothing).  It was
/// ISSUE THROUGHPUT - ~8.4M iterations of 6-8 instructions issued by ONE of 48 SMs.
///
/// This version splits the work the way the shapes want: `hc` blocks for the per-stream norm, one warp per
/// row for each of the two projections, and one block-tile for the mean.  The transposes are gone because the
/// warp-per-row mapping makes them unnecessary.
