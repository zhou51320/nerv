// include/strata/kernels/quantize_act.hpp - activation quantization, host-callable (P2.S2).
//
// `ggml_mul_mat` converts src1 (the ACTIVATION) to the weight's `vec_dot_type` before the dot product.  The
// CPU expert path already does this (`bench/micro/cpu_s2.cpp`, int8 + vpdpbusd, parity 1.461e-06); the GPU
// kernels take FP16 activations.  Leaving the two inconsistent means the same token computes different
// numbers for different experts, so this is the GPU half of the same rule.
//
// Q2_0 -> Q8_0 is the case that matters most: the routed experts are all Q2_0, which is 31.64 GiB of the 38
// GiB pack.  Q8_K is the OTHER HALF of `VEC_DOT_TYPE` (Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K/IQ4_XS) and covers 2.89 GiB of
// dense weights - the attention projections and `ssm_out`, i.e. the numerically sensitive ones.
//
// `docs/activation-contract.md` records the decision that BOTH must exist and be used: an FP16 activation
// against a quantized weight disagrees with the oracle by 0.6-0.9%, which is 6-9x P2.S2's 1e-3 tolerance.

// `quantize_q8_0`) and the two disagreed: `ActQ::scale` is fp32 while a `block_q8_0` stores fp16 `d`, which is
// **4.761e-04 relative on 80 of 80 chunks** (`bench/micro/act_quant_parity.cu`).  This variant exists so the
// hit path can use the CPU's multiplier.  Writes `blocks[n/32 * 34]` and `scales[n/32]`; `scales` must not be
// null.  `quantize_q8_0` is unchanged and still matches ggml's bytes, which is what `moe_hit_parity` checks.

// This is `quantize_row_q8_K_ref` (ggml-quants.c L2768) transcribed, including the two things that look like
// mistakes and are not:
//
//   * the scale is `-127/max`, NOT `-128/max`.  The source carries the `-128` version COMMENTED OUT with the
//     note that IQ2_XXS needs the change for an awkward AVX implementation.  Getting this wrong is a 0.79%
//     scaling error - the same order as the quantisation step, so it yields a working-looking activation that
//     ggml never sees.  It cost round 120.
//   * `max` is the SIGNED value at the position of the largest magnitude, so a POSITIVE max gives a NEGATIVE
//     iscale and the `+max` element maps to -127 while the `-max` element maps to +127.
//
// The rounding is `nearest_int`, which is round-half-to-EVEN via the 12582912.0f magic number - not
// `roundf`'s half-away-from-zero.  They differ only on exact ties, i.e. almost never on real data, which is
// precisely why the wrong one would survive any amount of end-to-end testing; the parity test constructs
// exact ties on purpose.
