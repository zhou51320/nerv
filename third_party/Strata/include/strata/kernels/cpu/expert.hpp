// include/strata/kernels/cpu/expert.hpp - P2.S3: the CPU expert path.
//
// This is the Q2_0 expert kernel promoted out of `bench/micro/cpu_s2.cpp`, which is the instrument that
// measured `c` (Memory/LEDGER.md L9/L10: 15.03 ms for one token's full routed set on 6 cores, DRAM-bound at
// 44.14 GB/s) and whose P0.T2 parity passes at 1.461e-06.
//
// IT IS THE SAME CODE, NOT A COPY.  Keeping a second implementation next to a validated one is how a project
// ends up with two answers and no way to say which is right, so `cpu_s2.cpp` is expected to become a thin
// benchmark over these functions.  (Until it is, the two exist side by side and this header says so.)
//
// WHAT MAKES IT FAST, and each of the three was paid for once:
//
//   * `vpdpbusd` (AVX512-VNNI) does four int8 MACs per instruction.  The scalar loop it replaces ran at
//     9.89 GB/s on one core; VNNI is the reason the 6-core figure is 42.55 GB/s.
//   * `vpmultishiftqb` (AVX512-VBMI) unpacks the 2-bit codes eight at a time.  Its ARGUMENT ORDER is
//     (control, data) and was determined empirically - the Intel guide states the opposite, and following the
//     guide produced 43 of 64 wrong codes.
//   * The row accumulator stays a FLOAT VECTOR and is reduced ONCE at the end of the row.  Reducing per
//     64-weight block cost more than the dot products themselves: it made the kernel compute-bound at
//     21 GB/s instead of DRAM-bound at 32.
//
// THE CONTRACT THAT MATTERS, because collapsing it is invisible and cannot match ggml's logits: one Q2_0
// WEIGHT block is QK=64 weights with one fp16 scale, while one ACTIVATION chunk is QKA=32 elements with
// its OWN scale.  So a weight block spans TWO activation chunks with two different scales.  Using one scale
// per weight block is the natural-looking mistake.
