// include/strata/kernels/ple.hpp - P2.S4: the PLE block's GPU half (`build_ple`, qwen4exp.cpp L1206-1293).
//
// One token, sixteen gathered rows of 160 -> a residual-stack update:
//
//     key       = grouped_norm(ple_key   @ emb)          hc_dim, per-stream RMS then a [n_embd,hc] gamma
//     query     = grouped_norm(hidden,   ple_norm_query)
//     value     = ple_value @ emb                        n_embd
//     s[c]      = sum_d(key[c]*query[c]) / sqrt(n_embd)
//     gate[c]   = sigmoid(sign(s) * sqrt(max(|s|, 1e-6)))     signed square root, then sigmoid
//     gated[c]  = value * gate[c]                        value broadcast over the hc streams
//     normalized= grouped_norm(gated, ple_norm_conv)     <-- THE CONV INPUT
//     conv      = sum_k kW[k][c] * padded[hist + t - (kern-1-k)*dil][c]
//     out       = hidden + gated + silu(conv)
//
// **`normalized` IS THE CONV INPUT, AND `ref/ngram.py` SAYS OTHERWISE.**  Its `ple_block` docstring calls
// `terms` "the padded gated values", but the source pads `normalized` - the grouped_norm of the gated values,
// not the gated values themselves - and `ple_layer_xcheck.cpp` L107-112 builds it that way from ggml.  The
// reference computes `normalized` and then ignores it, passing `terms` in from the caller, so its own code
// does not contradict its docstring and nothing catches it.  This header takes the HISTORY OF NORMALIZED
// ROWS, which is what the state actually is.
//
// WHERE THE WEIGHTS LIVE, and the two different layouts in play.  `ple_conv1d.weight` has manifest shape
// [4, 10240] with ne0 = 4 fast, so ggml's flat index is `k + 4*c`; `ref/ngram.py`'s `kernel` is a (4, 10240)
// numpy array whose flat index is `k*10240 + c`.  They are transposes, and the source's own view
// (`ggml_view_2d(tWc, 1, hc_dim, nb[1], k*nb[0])`) confirms which is meant.  `ple_key` and `ple_value` are
// [2560, n] with ne0 = 2560 fast, which IS the reference's row-major orientation.
