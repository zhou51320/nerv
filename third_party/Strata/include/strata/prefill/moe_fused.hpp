// include/strata/prefill/moe_fused.hpp - #136 (prompt speed): the routed experts of a Q2_0 pack in the prompt path on
// Strata's own int8 tensor-core kernels, opt-in with STRATA_PF_FUSED=1 (NVIDIA sm_80 and newer; sm_75 and HIP: MMQ).
//
// The MMQ path (moe_mmq.hpp) per MoE layer: a host sync to group the (token, k) pairs by expert, a gather of each
// expert into a 16-expert group buffer, then per group the q8_1 activations of every routed slot, gate/up, SwiGLU,
// the q8_1 of H and down - five passes over per-slot buffers.  Here:
//   - the activations are rounded to int8 once per TOKEN (not per slot), with a scale per 32 values;
//   - the grouping (counts, offsets, the rows of each expert, a list of 64-row tiles) runs on the GPU from the
//     router's ids, so the host never waits for the routing;
//   - one launch per batch of up to kMaxBatch experts reads each expert where it already is (a resident cache slot
//     or a slot of the streamed ring: a pointer per expert, no gather) - gate/up with SwiGLU and the int8 rounding
//     of H in its epilogue, then down into the per-slot rows the existing combine reads.
// The 2-bit codes are unpacked in registers and multiplied with mma.sync m16n8k32 (s8 x s8 -> s32); Q2_0's offset
// (w = d * (q - 1)) is folded into the activation blocks' sums.  The numbers differ from MMQ's (another int8
// rounding of the activations and of H) by about as much as MMQ differs from FP32 (tests/cuda/prefill_fused_moe_test).
