// include/strata/prefill/gemm.hpp - plan v0.3 P5: the batched projections of prompt processing.
//
// Every projection of a chunk of T tokens is Y[T, N] = X[T, K] . W[N, K]^T with W row-major (the GGUF / pack layout)
// and FP32 outputs.  Weights are BF16 on the device - either already (the pack's BF16 tensors) or dequantized from
// their native GGUF blocks into a reusable scratch (`dequant_bf16`) right before the product - and activations are
// rounded to BF16, which is also what llama.cpp's batched CUDA path does.  Tensor-core GEMM through cuBLAS.
