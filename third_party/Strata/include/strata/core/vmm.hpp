// CUDA virtual memory (the elastic K/V, --kv-grow): an address range reserved once, whose physical memory is mapped and
// unmapped in chunks of the device's granularity (2 MiB).  The K/V pools grow with the context by taking chunks the
// expert cache gives up, and neither moves: every captured graph and stored pointer stays valid.  The driver calls
// are reached through the runtime's entry-point query, so nothing links the driver library.  Not under HIP.
