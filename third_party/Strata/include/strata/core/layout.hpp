// include/strata/core/layout.hpp - the pack's LAYOUT, resolved by name and checked against the kernels.
//
// `WeightTable` answers "where are the bytes".  This answers "is this the tensor I think it is", and it is
// the layer where a pack and a kernel disagree - which is the failure this project keeps paying for.  Two
// examples, both real:
//
//   * round 194 sized the indexer key store from `indexer.head_count = 4`, which counts QUERY heads.  The
//     cached key is ONE shared head of 128 (`indexer.k_proj` is [2560, 128]), so the term was 4x too big and
//     the error survived a round because it moved in the direction that TIGHTENS the budget.
//   * `docs/semantics.md` and the tensor manifest agree on every dimension here, but nothing CHECKED that a
//     named tensor had the shape the kernel reading it assumes.
//
// So this header does two things: it names the tensors per layer type, and it asserts every shape the
// kernels depend on.  A mismatch is reported with the tensor name, the shape found and the shape required,
// at LOAD time - not as a wrong number inside a GEMV at token 4000.
