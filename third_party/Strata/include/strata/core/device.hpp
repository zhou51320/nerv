// include/strata/core/device.hpp - P2.S1: the device arena and the runtime's device facts.
//
// `DeviceArena` is ONE cudaMalloc per planner region with bump sub-allocation below it and no frees.  That is
// not a simplification for the first version: the memory plan from P1.S9 is fixed at startup, so the set of
// regions and their sizes is known before anything is allocated, and an allocator that can free would be
// solving a problem the engine does not have while adding fragmentation and failure modes it does.
//
// The reason to get this in early is that the VRAM budget is the binding constraint of the whole design
// (5.95 GB pooled between KV and the expert cache, 33.97 GB of experts in DRAM).  A runtime that discovers at
// token 4000 that it has overcommitted has already lost; the plan is printed against `cudaMemGetInfo` at
// startup so the discrepancy is visible immediately.
