// src/program/conv_cache_test.cpp - the conversation cache's retention policy: the shared root survives,
// the leaves rotate by least recent use.
//
// The scenarios, in the serve loop's terms (generate.cpp): checkpoints are a prefix chain - stamps[0] is
// the root, the deepest point every request so far has shared (the end of the system prompt, in practice).
// A stamp advances on creation, when a new checkpoint lands on an existing length, and when a request
// mounts through the checkpoint.
//
//   1. one conversation over its budget: the oldest leaf leaves - with fresh stamps in creation order this
//      is exactly the previous first-in-first-out behaviour;
//   2. the root survives arbitrarily many newer checkpoints however old its stamp is;
//   3. a mount advances a checkpoint's stamp and the rotation then takes a different leaf;
//   4. a one-slot budget has no room for root and leaf, so the pin is off and the oldest leaves (the
//      newest point stays, as before);
//   5. the policy is pure: the same stamps, the same victim.
