"""tools/iq_pack.py - plan v0.3 P6: a native pack for any of the model files (Q2_0, IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS).

    python tools/iq_pack.py --gguf <model>-00001-of-00002.gguf --out pack/iq3_xxs            (standalone)
    python tools/iq_pack.py --gguf <model>-00001-of-00002.gguf --base pack/full --out ...    (share dense.bin)

The i-quant experts cannot be re-expressed in the Q2_0 pack form, so this pack keeps every quantized tensor in
its GGUF form:

  experts.bin          optional (--experts-bin): per layer, 512 blobs of [gate rows | up rows | down rows], the
                       raw GGUF slices.  Blob size is per layer (the files mix IQ1_M ... IQ3_S gate/up and Q2_0 /
                       IQ4_NL down).  experts.bin.src.json says which source it was cut from (the shards' names and
                       sizes, the hash of native_experts.txt); an experts.bin is reused only when that matches.
  native_experts.txt   one line per layer: layer gu_type d_type offset blob_bytes gate_off up_off down_off [shard];
                       written last, so a pack without it is not finished
  index.txt            the table the engine loads.  Quantized dense tensors, token_embd and output are served
                       natively from the GGUF by the engine (--native): their rows carry shape only.
  dense.bin            standalone: the BF16/F16/F32 tensors in the form the engine reads them (index kinds 4/5/2;
                       3 = F32 narrowed to F16 by the loader) - as the GGUF stores them, or converted (FORM below).
  conversions.json     every tensor that was converted: shard, source/destination type, method, whether it was
                       exact, the largest absolute error, the source bytes' sha256 (schema 1).
                       With --base: the base (Q2_0) pack's dense.bin, hard-linked - the float tensors are
                       byte-identical in all three model files (checked) - plus extra.bin for tensors that are
                       float here but quantized in the base pack (blk.1.ple_key).
  tokenizer/           exported from the GGUF (tools/strata_tokenizer.py), with the model's chat template.

Split files: every shard of the model is read (<name>-0000N-of-0000M.gguf beside --gguf; a missing shard is an
error), so the layers may be split anyhow (Swift 1.5's GGUFs put layers 13-47 in shard 2 and the PLE table in
shard 1).  A layer whose experts are not in shard 1 names its shard in native_experts.txt (v3).  A shard boundary
may even fall inside a layer (Unsloth's UD-Q4_K_XL: layer 11's down in shard 2, its gate and up in shard 3): that
layer's shard column is per role, `gate,up,down` (an empty field = the --gguf shard), and only then is the file
v4, so an older engine refuses it instead of misreading it.  Every other pack stays v3, byte for byte.  Router
tensors stored as F32 whose values are exactly BF16 (Swift 1.5) are written as BF16, the form the engine's router
takes (so are the other F32 tensors the engine reads as BF16, when exact); anything else is refused.

For ordinary quants, --compat-bf16 dequantizes the small projections that the engine reads as BF16, using
round-to-nearest-even. This introduces BF16 rounding; it does not reconstruct the original full-precision
weights. Experts, native attention projections, token embeddings, a Q2_0/Q8_0 PLE key and the disk-backed PLE
table stay unchanged.
