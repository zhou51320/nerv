"""serve/winjob.py - on Windows, tie the processes Strata starts to the server's own lifetime.

Closing the console window, Task Manager or a crash end the server without running its cleanup, and the engine,
the vision encoder and the MCP servers kept running on their own. `contain(proc)` puts a child in a job object that
is set to kill everything in it when its last handle closes - and the only handle is this process's, which the OS
closes however the server ends. Processes the child starts later join the same job. The server itself stays out of
the job, so a browser that `--open` starts is not tied to it. Each child (and the server) is also opted out of Windows
power throttling, see `no_throttle` (#691). Elsewhere, and if the job cannot be made, a no-op.
